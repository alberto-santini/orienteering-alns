# Prerequisites

The programme can be built in a straightforward way, provided that all required libraries are available.
These are:

* The CPLEX solver by IBM, including its C++ API and the Concert API.
* The [LKH](http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/) heuristic solver for the Travelling Salesman Problem.
* The [CImg](http://cimg.eu/) image manipulation library.
* The [ProgramOptions.hxx](https://github.com/Fytch/ProgramOptions.hxx) library.
* My own library of miscellaneous utilities, called AS and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/alberto-santini/as).
* My ALNS (Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search) library, also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/alberto-santini/adaptive-large-neighbourhood-search).
